## 1. Product definition

Our page shows all about the pokemons that live in the Kanto region. It is made for beginner and intermediate users who know the Pokemon Go game and when they are playing they can enter our page and learn more.

## 2. UX Research

Through a survey we wanted to know a little more about the users of the game and we asked beginner and intermediate users what they identified as their needs to create our user stories and develop the project.

## 3. User story

- H1: As a beginner player I want to know all the available pokemons to find which ones I need
- H2: As an intermediate player I want to filter the pokemons by element to know which of my pokemons I can use in certain battles.
- H4: As an intermediate player, I want to know how many pokemons belong to each type
- H4: As a beginner player I want to look for a specific pokemon to know its characteristics

## 4. Prototypes

### High prototype

#### Color palette:

<p align="center"> <img src="https://github.com/paulalenisb/BOG001-data-lovers/blob/master/src/images/Pokemon_ColorPalette.jpeg" width="500"> </p >

## 6. Usability test

Thanks to the usability test with different users, as we progressed through the stories, we were able to carry out different iterations of the visual and usability part of the project, such as the different clicks for the buttons, some colors that did not refer to our color palette, the modal view and some responsive settings.
